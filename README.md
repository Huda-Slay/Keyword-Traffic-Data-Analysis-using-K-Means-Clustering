# Keyword-Traffic-Data-Analysis-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project focuses on analyzing keyword traffic data to identify meaningful clusters based on Keyword ID and Cost Per Click (CPC) values. Using K-Means Clustering, we segment keywords into groups with similar traffic and cost behavior — which can help in optimizing keyword strategies and understanding ad performance patterns.
